# DataScientist Case Studies 
Project 1: Electricity Load Forecasting using a dataset from American Electric Power (AEP)
Project 2: Inbred Line Genomic Prediction Pipeline

Project 1 has been constructed using a public dataset from American Electric Power (AEP), where an initial explanatory data analysis followed by prediction and future forecast trend was done. Python was used for aforementioned analyses/pipeline. 

And, the project 2 is one the recent projects as data scientist at my current company. Not all the results and code was presented (some parts of code was altered in view of maintaining the confidentiality I am adhered to, due to this, an end to end pipeline was not presented here, however production ready pipeline has been made readily available. R programming language was used for aforementioned analyses/pipeline.
